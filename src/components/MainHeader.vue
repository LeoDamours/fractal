                This project is an essay in fractals. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more about fractals and how to create them.
                The goals of this project are to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generate fractals using different algorithms</li>
                <li>Explore the mathematics behind fractals</li>
                <li>Making the fractal responsive of different parameters</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The main challenge of this project is to make a 3D representation of a mountains using an algorithm that generates fractals.
